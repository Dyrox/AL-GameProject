terminal velocity: there is this concept in physics called the terminal velocity, where an object in free fall reaches a fixed velocity after a certain period of time, even though the gravity is accelerating the object down, thereâ€™s an upward opposing air resistance force slowing down the acceleration, as the object falls quicker, the air resistance also increases. When these forces are equal, acceleration = 0 and the object reaches terminal velocity.
